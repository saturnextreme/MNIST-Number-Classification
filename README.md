# MNIST Number Classification using TensorFlow

## Project Description

This IPython Notebook demonstrates the process of building a deep neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and is a commonly used dataset for image classification tasks.

In this project, we will use TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning library, to create and train a neural network for accurately classifying these handwritten digits.
